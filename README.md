Garbage level monitoring solutions use sensors, like ultrasound or radar, to identify fill-levels and report them to Application in real-time. They can identify abnormal changes in level and alert managers immediately of potential issues like Gas level. With greater visibility over Garbage usage, Application can better optimize inventory management and service schedules to improve operational efficiency, ensuring that they receive every refilling right when they need it.
Garbage level monitoring systems allow users to remotely gather data from multiple Garbage across Street or across state lines, with the same high level of accuracy every time, eliminating surprises and equipping Application with the information they need to improve efficiency.
#### How It Works
- We have to fix The Level Sensor And Gas Sensor Inside the Garbage Can , The Sensor Inside the Garbage Can Get Charge By SolorPanel
- Sensor Connected With Network Hub Like Raspberry pi Which Connected With Global Network And Transit The Data To Firbase 
- Data Inside The Firebase Is Recived By The Application Using Firebase Json Policies
- The Application Has interactive Dashbord Which visualize the Data in Actractive Manner
- The Level Sensor Is Used To Check Garbage Can Storage And Gas Sensor Is Used to Detech Gas Inside the Garbage Can
